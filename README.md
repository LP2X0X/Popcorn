# 🍿 Popcorn

Popcorn is a movie search and rating web app built with **React**.  
You can search for your favorite movies, see details, and give your own rating — all stored locally in your browser.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Search Movies** — Find movies quickly using an external API or local data.
- ⭐ **Rate Movies** — Add your personal rating for any movie.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** — Your ratings are saved with **localStorage**, so they stay even after you reload.

## 🧠 What I Learned

While building Popcorn, I learned how to:
- Structure a React app into reusable and composable components.
- Use React hooks effectively (`useEffect`, `useRef`, custom hooks).
- Store and retrieve user data using `localStorage`.
- Apply consistent visual design choices (colors, typography, and layout).
